# intelligent-it-help-desk-automation-and-classification
This project aims to build a pipeline that automatically processes incoming messages to an IT department. The goal is to create a system that classifies requests by routing clear, script-readable information to a rule-based engine (Regex) and sending ambiguous cases to an LLM.
